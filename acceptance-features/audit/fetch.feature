Feature: Fetch audit events

  Background:
    Given I successfully run `conjur variable create $ns/secret MY_SECRET`
    And I successfully run `conjur variable value $ns/secret`
    
  Scenario: Fetch works
    When I successfully run `conjur audit resource -s variable:$ns/secret`
    Then the output should match /checked that they can execute .*:variable:.*secret/

  Scenario: Follow works
      # Implementation constraints prevent an exit code of 0 when using
    # --follow and --limit, so can't say "When I run successfully..."
    When I run `conjur audit resource -s -f -l 2 variable:$ns/secret`
    Then the output should match /checked that they can execute .*:variable:.*secret/
